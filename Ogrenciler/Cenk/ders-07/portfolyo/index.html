        <div class="textbox">
          <p class="about-me-text">
            Hello, I am Mustafa Cenk Aydın. I graduated from the Computer
            Engineering Department at Karadeniz Technical University. Throughout
            my academic and professional journey, I have focused extensively on
            advanced technology fields such as artificial intelligence, deep
            learning, and image processing. <br />
            <br />
            During my university years, I served as the Vice Chairperson of the
            Board of Directors and the R&D Chairperson of the KTÜ Artificial
            Intelligence Club, honing my leadership skills. Additionally, I
            played critical roles in Teknofest and various technology
            competitions as a team leader, software manager, and algorithm
            specialist. Some of my notable achievements include: <br />
            <br />
            2024 Vakıfbank Hack to the Future Competition: Most Innovative
            Technological Solution Award, <br />2024 Teknofest T3 AI Hackathon:
            Team Member – 3rd Place, <br />2024 Teknofest Autonomous Marine
            Vehicle Competition: Software Manager – Finalist, <br />2024
            Teknofest Air Defense Systems Competition: Software Manager –
            Finalist, <br />2023 Teknofest International UAV Competition:
            Competition Manager – 3rd Place, <br />2022 Teknofest International
            UAV Competition: Software Manager – Localization Category 3rd Place.
            <br />
            <br />In the summer of 2023, I completed an internship at TÜBİTAK
            ULAKBİM TRUBA, working on advanced projects in artificial
            intelligence and deep learning. I enhanced my problem-solving skills
            by understanding the mathematical foundations of the Gradient
            Descent algorithm and implementing it from scratch without using
            libraries. I also delved into data preprocessing techniques and
            developed a custom CNN architecture for facial emotion recognition
            using TensorFlow. Moreover, I gained hands-on experience with
            high-performance systems by training AI models on supercomputers
            using HPC and SLURM infrastructures. <br />
            <br />In 2024, I completed my internship at the Software Design Unit
            of ROKETSAN. During this time, I worked on Visual Odometry and
            position estimation for GNSS-FREE environments. I developed
            innovative solutions for determining positions without Global
            Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data by utilizing ORB, SIFT, and
            optical flow algorithms. This experience provided me with an
            in-depth understanding of image processing and an opportunity to
            apply practical solutions to real-world engineering challenges.
            <br />
            <br />My technical proficiencies include Python (TensorFlow,
            PyTorch, OpenCV), deep learning, machine learning, and
            multi-threaded programming. I aim to advance my career by focusing
            on artificial intelligence and image processing technologies. I
            strongly believe in continuous learning and developing impactful
            solutions through teamwork. <br />
            <br />
            I am always open to new projects and collaborations. Feel free to
            reach out!
